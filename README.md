## Overview

A comprehensive dashboard card for managing and monitoring your Pi-hole DNS ad blocker directly from Home Assistant. The card provides real-time statistics and controls in an intuitive, dashboard-style interface that matches the Pi-hole visual identity.

## Features

### Dashboard Statistics

- **Main Statistics Dashboard** - Four color-coded tiles showing your most important Pi-hole metrics:
  - Total DNS Queries
  - Queries Blocked
  - Block Percentage
  - Domains on Blocklists

![Dashboard Statistics](assets/dashboard-stats.png)

### Additional Metrics

- **Client Statistics** - See active clients, unique domains, unique clients, etc.
- **Performance Data** - View cached queries and forwarded DNS requests
- **Interactive Elements** - Configurable tap, hold, and double-tap actions for all metrics

![Additional Metrics](assets/additional-metrics.png)

### Direct Controls

- **Enable/Disable Controls** - Toggle Pi-hole filtering with a single click as well as Group Default
- **Action Buttons** - Quick access buttons for common maintenance tasks:
  - Restart DNS
  - Update Gravity
  - Flush ARP
  - Flush Logs
- **Customizable Actions** - Configure custom actions for the control buttons in this section

![Control Buttons](assets/control-buttons.png)

### Version Information

- **Component Versions** - Display installed versions for all Pi-hole components:
  - Core
  - Docker
  - FTL
  - Web Interface
  - Home Assistant Integration
  - Last Refresh Time

![Version Information](assets/version-info.png)

### Status Monitoring

- **Real-time Status** - Visual indication of Pi-hole's current state
- **Error Detection** - Automatic highlighting when issues are detected
- **Update Indicators** - Clear notification when updates are available
- **Block Time Remaining** - Shows how much time remaining until blocking enables

![block-time](assets/block-time.png)

### Interactive Dashboard

- **Clickable Elements** - All sections can be configured with custom actions
- **Visual Indicators** - Color-coded statistics to understand status at a glance
- **Customizable Card** - Set custom title and icon to match your dashboard style
- **Entity Filtering** - Ability to exclude specific entities or entire sections

![filtering](assets/filtering.png)

### Multi-Pi-hole Support

- **Centralized Control** - Manage multiple Pi-hole instances from a single card
- **Aggregated Status** - See at a glance how many of your Pi-holes are active
- **Unified Control** - Centralized access to all switches from your Pi-hole instances
- **Intelligent Status Indicators** - Status automatically adjusts based on collective state:
  - Shows "Running" when all instances are active
  - Shows "Partial" when some instances are active and some are inactive
  - Shows count of active instances (e.g., "2/3")

Example of Partial
![Multi Pi-hole Status](assets/multi-pihole-partial.png)

Example of all Running
![Multi Pi-hole All Running](assets/multi-pihole-running.png)

> [!NOTE]  
> The multi-Pi-hole feature currently has some limitations:
>
> - Statistics shown are from the first Pi-hole in the list only
> - All switches from all Pi-holes are displayed in a single list
> - Only header status reflects the multi-Pi-hole state

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile-friendly** - Optimized layout for both desktop and mobile viewing
- **Fluid Layout** - Responsive design adapts to available space

## Installation

### Prerequisites

> [!WARNING]  
> Before using this card, please ensure you have the [Pi-hole v6 integration](https://github.com/bastgau/ha-pi-hole-v6) installed in your Home Assistant instance.

### HACS (Recommended)

[![HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=homeassistant-extras&repository=pi-hole-card&category=dashboard)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Click the menu icon in the top right and select "Custom repositories"
3. Add this repository URL and select "Dashboard" as the category
   - `https://github.com/homeassistant-extras/pi-hole-card`
4. Click "Install"

### Manual Installation

1. Download the `pi-hole-card.js` file from the latest release in the Releases tab.
2. Copy it to your `www/community/pi-hole-card/` folder
3. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` (or add as a resource in dashboards menu)

```yaml
lovelace:
  resources:
    - url: /local/community/pi-hole-card/pi-hole-card.js
      type: module
```

## Usage

Add the card to your dashboard using the UI editor or YAML:

### Card Editor

The card is fully configurable through the card editor, allowing you to customize:

- Pi-hole device selection (single or multiple)
- Card title and icon
- Custom actions for statistics, info panels, and control buttons

![editor](assets/editor.png)

### YAML

This is the most minimal configuration needed to get started:

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id: your_pihole_device_id
```

For multiple Pi-hole instances:

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id:
  - your_first_pihole_device_id
  - your_second_pihole_device_id
  - etc..
```

The card will automatically:

- Detect all Pi-hole entities associated with the device(s)
- Organize statistics in the dashboard layout
- Display control buttons for common actions
- Show version information for all components
- For multiple Pi-holes: combine switches and show aggregated status

## Configuration Options

| exclude_entities | list            | _none_       | Entities to remove from the card.                     |

### Action Configuration

Each section (stats, info, controls) supports the following action types:

| Name              | Type   | Default    | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| tap_action        | object | _optional_ | Action to perform when tapped        |
| hold_action       | object | _optional_ | Action to perform when held          |
| double_tap_action | object | _optional_ | Action to perform when double-tapped |

Actions can be configured to perform various operations such as:

- Toggle entities
- Show more info
- Call services
- Navigate to different views
- And more!

### Section Options

The following section names can be used with `exclude_sections`:

- header
- statistics
- sensors
- controls
- footer

### Auto-discovery

The card automatically discovers and identifies all Pi-hole entities based on:

- Entity naming patterns
- Translation keys
- Entity relationships to the device

This includes sensors, buttons, switches, binary sensors, and update entities.
